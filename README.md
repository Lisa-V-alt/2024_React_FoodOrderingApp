A 'food order' web app built with React, which:
- displays products (in components), a cart (in a modal) and a checkout form (in a modal),
- fetches 'dummy' meal data from a backend & displays it on the screen (GET /meals),
- allows users to add & remove products to & from the cart,
- sends cart data along with user data (name, email, street, postal code, city) to the backend (POST /orders),
- handles loading & error states.
